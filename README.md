# CHANGELOG #

**24.12.2014**
Bootstrap layouts and templates applied to main:index, blog:list and blog:post pages.

**23.12.2014**
Bootstrap blog proto layout and some bootstrap themes added

**21.12.2014**
3rd party utilities removed (Class-based views helpers changed to list_view(request) 
and detail_view(request, pk) - it is easier and more practical as for me).
Captcha added to comment form. 3rd party paginator removed from list view (need to use original)

**21.12.2014**
Template engine changed to [Jinja2 (django-jinja)](http://niwibe.github.io/django-jinja/) 

**20.12.2014**
Starts real blog app creation, based on [this manual](http://yiiframework.ru/doc/blog/ru/start.overview) 

**20.12.2014**
Bootstrap and jQuery added as static files. I do not want to use it as pip modules: 
it is hard to update and buggy in use.

**20.12.2014**
Dummy blog added from [lightbird.net](http://lightbird.net/dbe2/blog.html)
